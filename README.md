ripdrag is an application that lets you drag and drop files from and to the terminal.

It's designed to be feature to feature* compatible with [dragon](https://github.com/mwh/dragon), while being written in modern Rust and GTK4.

*some features like --on-top can't be ported over because of limitations in gtk4
# Use cases

Many applications expect files to be dragged into them. Normally you would have to put your beloved terminal aside and open a file manager to that, but now you can just type ```ripdrag FILENAME``` and be done.

Used in combination with a fuzzy finder like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - e.g. ```ripdrag $(fzf)``` - can make for an amazingly quick and painless terminal experience.
